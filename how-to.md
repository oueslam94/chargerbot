# Documentation

## Usage:

### Monitoring chargers:

- Using [/], [/qry], [/sql]: Users can monitor the states of all chargers at Joby.

### Assigning a Charger to Yourself:

If you are about to charge at a Joby EV charger, please follow these steps to let other Jobians know who to reach out to in case they need to get a hold of you.

1. Once parked next to a charger and plugged in, use your smartphone to scan the QR code next to charger name, the landing page should look like this:

2. Follow the instructions on the landing page by copying the command to your clipboard, then pasting in on any channel in slack (Don't worry, nothing will be actually posted to that channel).
3. If successful, you should see a message like this:
   ![alt text](https://cdn.glitch.com/b81dd1a0-835d-48d2-bf45-82e71d46b316%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-08-22%20at%202.38.18%20PM.png?v=1629668311016)
4. Your slack handle should now appear on the main landing page!
